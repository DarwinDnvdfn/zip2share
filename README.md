## How It Works üîç

Zip2Share uses standard file compression techniques to package multiple files into a single ZIP archive. When you select files, the app creates a temporary ZIP file in the background. Once the compression is complete, it leverages Android's share intent to allow you to share the zipped file through various apps installed on your device.
